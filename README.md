# Credit-Scoring
🧠 Credit Scoring for Individuals
Welcome to the Credit Scoring Project — a comprehensive data science pipeline that predicts individual creditworthiness using historical loan data. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making data-driven lending decisions while showcasing end-to-end skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

🚀 Project Overview
This project walks through all major stages of a real-world machine learning task:

📊 Data Exploration & Visualization
Gain insights into demographic and financial features affecting loan approvals.

🧼 Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and perform dimensionality reduction (PCA).

🧠 Model Building
Train multiple ML models like:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Linear Regression (for exploratory score modeling)

📈 Evaluation
Evaluate models using:

Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

MAE, RMSE, R² (for regression comparisons)

🧪 Testing on Separate Data
Validate performance on a hold-out test dataset.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project uses Python and the following libraries:

pandas, numpy – data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization

scikit-learn – preprocessing, modeling, evaluation

scipy – statistical testing

tqdm – progress visualization

📂 Files
Indiv_credit_score.ipynb – Main Jupyter notebook with full analysis

loan-train.csv, loan-test.csv – Training and testing datasets

📌 Key Highlights
Visual analysis of features like income, loan amount, and co-applicant contributions

Comparison of classification vs regression approaches to credit scoring

Feature selection via SelectKBest, VarianceThreshold, and Random Forest importance

Use of pipelines and preprocessing transformers for clean code structure

💡 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)

Add explainability (SHAP, LIME)

Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit app to demonstrate interactive predictions
